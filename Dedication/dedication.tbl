# This file is part of a collection developed first for a course in   #
# financial optimization taught out of the text of Cornuejols and     #
# Tutuncu and then adapted for a tutorial on modeling and the COIN-OR #
# Optimization Suite. Materials for the original course on financial  #
# optimization are hosted here:                                       #
